Typical Stuff:

1) git clone ...
2) I like having gems in a Gemfile so that I can just intall the bundle
[(sudo) bundle i
nstall], having bundler as a pre-req[ (sudo) gem install bundler]
3)generated a dummy rails project just for the default sqlite3 database.yml:
rails new dummy -d sqlite3
4) get an aws account and pase the api key & secret into the config/setup.yml
5) make a twitter account and api key and setup the api_secret and token, make the server a whatever.com/pawns/finalize



4) rake db:migrate or rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
5) rake db:seed
6) 


4)Went into console and made a new user
./script/console
User.create(:login => "cats", :email => "test@test.com", :password => "pass", :password_confirmation => "pass")
5)./script/server
6)
